## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this module challenge was to use SQLALchemy to obtain statistical results requested from W.Avy. W.Avy is requesting this information because they are considering opening a surf and ice cream shop and want tod etermine if it is sustainable year round. The information that was requested was to gather the temperature data for the months of June and December. After gathering the data through using SQLALchemy, we then needed to convert the data to a list and dataframe as well as print out a report of the statistics summary.
